# Homework 1 IPC UNITN

The computer i have worked on has this processor: 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 @ 2.80GHz 2.80 GHz x64 based proccesor.

To run the files in this cluster you have to upload the files to the unitn cluster. When this is done you need to start a Interactive sesison with the command :
  qsub -I -q short_cpuQ

To run the code without flags type this in the interactive session: 
	 Gcc filename.c 
	 ./a.out

To run the code with flags type this in the interactive session: 
   Gcc filname.c -flag -o compiledfile
  ./compiledfile

In the commands described above, The filename is the name of the c file. And the compiledfile, is what you chose to call the comilated file.
